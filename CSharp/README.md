# Create a project in C# and .NET

This document will serve as a guide to start a C# and .NET project using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as IDE.

## Installation

To begin we must have downloaded the .Net sdk, we will find it in the following address:

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download

In our local we will create a folder where our projects will be hosted, when this folder is already created we will open it in console, we are ready to start creating our projects.

### Commands to create different types of projects

```bash
  dotnet new console ProjectName
```
With this command we will create the skeleton of a console project.

```bash
  dotnet new webapp ProjectName
```
With this command we will create the skeleton of a monolith type project.

```bash
  dotnet new web api ProjectName
```
With this command we will create the skeleton of an API type project.
